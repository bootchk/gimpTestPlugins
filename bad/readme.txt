Plugins in this directory:

gleaned mostly from github

some may execute but not have a seeming valid result
some may throw an exception


not very useful for testing for one or more reasons:
- no reasonable defaults
- can't understand what the result should be
- poor programming practices making it impossible to quickly understand the code
